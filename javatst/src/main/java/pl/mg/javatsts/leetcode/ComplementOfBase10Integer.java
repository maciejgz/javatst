 * Every non-negative integer N has a binary representation.  For example, 5 can be represented as "101" in binary, 11
 * as "1011" in binary, and so on.  Note that except for N = 0, there are no leading zeroes in any binary representation.
 * <p>
 * The complement of a binary representation is the number in binary you get when changing every 1 to a 0 and 0 to a 1.
 * For example, the complement of "101" in binary is "010" in binary.
 * <p>
 * For a given number N in base-10, return the complement of it's binary representation as a base-10 integer.

 * <p>
 * Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord.
 * <p>
 * You have to check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
 * <p>
 * Return the index of the word in sentence where searchWord is a prefix of this word (1-indexed).
 * <p>
 * If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
 * <p>
 * A prefix of a string S is any leading contiguous substring of S.

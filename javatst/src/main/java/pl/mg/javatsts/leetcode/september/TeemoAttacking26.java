 * In LOL world, there is a hero called Teemo and his attacking can make his enemy Ashe be in poisoned condition.
 * Now, given the Teemo's attacking ascending time series towards
 * Ashe and the poisoning time duration per Teemo's attacking, you need to output the total time that Ashe is in poisoned condition.
